# EZ-Analyst: Automated EDA and Analysis App

EZ-Analyst is a Streamlit-based application that streamlines the process of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and automates data analysis tasks. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, EZ-Analyst makes it easy for data analysts and enthusiasts to gain insights from their datasets quickly. The tool also leverages Open-AI to improve data analysis and generate code and reports easily.

## Features

- 📊 **Dataset Overview**: View the number of rows, columns, and duplicates in your dataset.
- 🕳️ **Missing Values**: Identify and summarize missing values in each column.
- 📈 **Data Statistics and Visualization**:
  - 🔢 Summary statistics for numerical columns
  - 📊 Statistics and value counts for categorical columns
- 📋 **Data Types**: Explore the data types of each column and filter columns by data type.
- 📊 **Individual Feature Distribution**: Analyze the distribution of individual numerical features using histogram, box plot, or KDE plot.
- 📈 **Scatter Plot**: Visualize the relationship between two numerical features.
- 📊 **Categorical Variable Analysis**: Analyze categorical variables using bar charts or pie charts.
- 🔍 **Feature Exploration**: Explore relationships between multiple numerical features using scatter plot matrix, pair plot, and correlation heatmap.
- 📊 **Categorical and Numerical Variable Analysis**: Analyze the relationship between a categorical and numerical variable using box plots.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
